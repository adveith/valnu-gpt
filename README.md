 The project is a chatbot designed to provide information about vulnerabilities based on Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) IDs. The chatbot reads data from an Excel file containing vulnerability details such as CWE ID, name, description, detection methods, and potential mitigations. Here's a breakdown of the project: Data Source: The vulnerability details are stored in an Excel file (New.xlsx). Each row represents a vulnerability, with columns for CWE ID, name, description, detection methods, and potential mitigations. Functionality: Extract CWE ID: The chatbot can extract CWE IDs from user input using regular expressions. Retrieve Details: It retrieves vulnerability details from the Excel file based on the CWE ID provided by the user. Generate Response: Once the details are retrieved, the chatbot generates a formatted response containing the vulnerability name, description, detection methods, and potential mitigations. User Interaction: The chatbot interacts with the user in a loop, continuously prompting for input until the user decides to exit. User Interface: The chatbot has a simple command-line interface. Users input a query containing a CWE ID, and the chatbot responds with the corresponding vulnerability details. Dependencies: pandas: Used for reading data from the Excel file and data manipulation. re: Used for regular expression matching to extract CWE IDs from user input. Purpose: The purpose of the chatbot is to provide users with quick access to information about software vulnerabilities, helping them understand the nature of the vulnerabilities and potential ways to mitigate them. Overall, the project aims to enhance user awareness of common software vulnerabilities and promote better security practices in software development and usage.
